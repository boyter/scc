# go-gitignore

Package `go-gitignore` provides an interface for parsing `.gitignore` files,
either individually, or within a repository, and
matching paths against the retrieved patterns. Path matching is done using
[fnmatch](https://github.com/danwakefield/fnmatch) as specified by
[git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore), with
support for recursive matching via the `**` pattern.

```go
import "github.com/denormal/go-gitignore"

// match a file against a particular .gitignore
ignore, err := gitignore.NewFromFile("/my/.gitignore")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
match := ignore.Match("/my/file/to.check")
if match != nil {
    if match.Ignore() {
        return true
    }
}

// or match against a repository
//  - here we match a directory path relative to the repository
ignore, err := gitignore.NewRepository( "/my/git/repository" )
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
match := ignore.Relative("src/examples", true)
if match != nil {
    if match.Include() {
        fmt.Printf(
            "include src/examples/ because of pattern %q at %s",
			match, match.Position(),
		)
    }
}

// if it's not important whether a path matches, but whether it is
// ignored or included...
if ignore.Ignore("src/test") {
    fmt.Println("ignore src/test")
} else if ignore.Include("src/github.com") {
    fmt.Println("include src/github.com")
}
```

## Patterns

`go-gitignore` supports the same `.gitignore` pattern format and matching rules as defined by [git](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore):

* A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.

* A line starting with `#` serves as a comment. Put a backslash `\` in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.

* Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash `\`.

* An optional prefix `!` which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesnâ€™t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash `\` in front of the first `!` for patterns that begin with a literal `!`, for example, `\!important!.txt`.

* If the pattern ends with a slash, it is removed for the purpose of the following description, but it would only find a match with a directory. In other words, `foo/` will match a directory foo and paths underneath it, but will not match a regular file or a symbolic link `foo` (this is consistent with the way how pathspec works in general in Git).

* If the pattern does not contain a slash `/`, Git treats it as a shell glob pattern and checks for a match against the pathname relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file (relative to the toplevel of the work tree if not from a `.gitignore` file).

* Otherwise, Git treats the pattern as a shell glob suitable for consumption by `fnmatch(3)` with the `FNM_PATHNAME` flag: wildcards in the pattern will not match a `/` in the pathname. For example, `Documentation/*.html` matches `Documentation/git.html` but not `Documentation/ppc/ppc.html` or `tools/perf/Documentation/perf.html`.

* A leading slash matches the beginning of the pathname. For example, `/*.c` matches `cat-file.c` but not `mozilla-sha1/sha1.c`.

Two consecutive asterisks `**` in patterns matched against full pathname may have special meaning:

* A leading `**` followed by a slash means match in all directories. For example, `**/foo` matches file or directory `foo` anywhere, the same as pattern `foo`. `**/foo/bar` matches file or directory `bar` anywhere that is directly under directory `foo`.

* A trailing `/**` matches everything inside. For example, `abc/**` matches all files inside directory `abc`, relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file, with infinite depth.

* A slash followed by two consecutive asterisks then a slash matches zero or more directories. For example, `a/**/b` matches `a/b`, `a/x/b`, `a/x/y/b` and so on.

* Other consecutive asterisks are considered invalid.

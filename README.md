Sloc Cloc and Code (scc)
------------------------

<img alt="scc" src=https://github.com/boyter/scc/raw/master/scc.jpg>

A tool similar to cloc, sloccount and tokei. For counting the lines of code, blank lines, comment lines, and physical lines of source code in many programming languages.

Goal is to be the fastest code counter possible, but also perform COCOMO calculation like sloccount and to estimate code complexity similar to cyclomatic complexity calculators. In short one tool to rule them all.

Also it has a very short name which is easy to type `scc`. 

If you don't like sloc cloc and code feel free to use the name `Succinct Code Counter`.

### Pitch

Why use `scc`?

 - It is very fast and gets faster the more CPU you throw at it
 - Accurate
 - Works very well across multiple platforms without slowdown (Windows, Linux, macOS)
 - Large language support
 - Can ignore duplicate files
 - Has complexity estimations
 - You need to tell the difference between Coq and Verilog in the same directory
 - cloc yaml output support so potentially a drop in replacement for some users
 - Can identify or ignore minified files
 - Able to identify many #! files ADVANCED! https://github.com/boyter/scc/issues/115
 - Can ignore large files by lines or bytes

Why not use `scc`?

 - You don't like Go for some reason
 - It cannot count D source with different nested multi-line comments correctly https://github.com/boyter/scc/issues/27

### Differences

There are some important differences between `scc` and other tools that are out there. Here are a few important ones for you to consider.

Blank lines inside comments are counted as comments. While the line is technically blank the decision was made that 
once in a comment everything there should be considered a comment until that comment is ended. As such the following,
 
```
/* blank lines follow


*/
```

Would be counted as 4 lines of comments. This is noticeable when comparing scc's output to other tools on large
repositories.

`scc` is able to count verbatim strings correctly. For example in C# the following,

```
private const string BasePath = @"a:\";
// The below is returned to the user as a version
private const string Version = "1.0.0";
```

Because of the prefixed @ this string ends at the trailing " by ignoring the escape character \ and as such should be 
counted as 2 code lines and 1 comment. Some tools are unable to
deal with this and instead count up to the "1.0.0" as a string which can cause the middle comment to be counted as
code rather than a comment.

`scc` will also tell you the number of bytes it has processed (for most output formats) allowing you to estimate the
cost of running some static analysis tools. 

### Usage

Command line usage of `scc` is designed to be as simple as possible.
Full details can be found in `scc --help` or `scc -h`. Note that the below reflects the state of master not a release, as such
features listed below may be missing from your installation.

```
$ scc -h

Note that you don't have to specify the directory you want to run against. Running `scc` will assume you want to run against the current directory.

You can also run against multiple files or directories `scc directory1 directory2 file1 file2` with the results aggregated in the output.

### Ignore Files

`scc` mostly supports .ignore files inside directories that it scans. This is similar to how ripgrep, ag and tokei work. .ignore files are 100% the same as .gitignore files with the same syntax, and as such `scc` will ignore files and directories listed in them. You can add .ignore files to ignore things like vendored dependency checked in files and such. The idea is allowing you to add a file or folder to git and have ignored in the count.

### Interesting Use Cases

Used inside Intel Nemu Hypervisor to track code changes between revisions https://github.com/intel/nemu/blob/topic/virt-x86/tools/cloc-change.sh#L9
Appears to also be used inside both http://codescoop.com/ https://pinpoint.com/ https://github.com/chaoss/grimoirelab-graal

It also is used to count code and guess language types in https://searchcode.com/ which makes it one of the most frequently run code counters in the world. 

You can also hook scc into your gitlab pipeline https://gitlab.com/guided-explorations/ci-cd-plugin-extensions/ci-cd-plugin-extension-scc

Also used by CodeQL https://github.com/boyter/scc/pull/317 and Scaleway https://twitter.com/Scaleway/status/1488087029476995074?s=20&t=N2-z6O-ISDdDzULg4o4uVQ

### Features

`scc` uses a small state machine in order to determine what state the code is when it reaches a newline `\n`. As such it is aware of and able to count

 - Single Line Comments
 - Multi Line Comments
 - Strings
 - Multi Line Strings
 - Blank lines

Because of this it is able to accurately determine if a comment is in a string or is actually a comment.

It also attempts to count the complexity of code. This is done by checking for branching operations in the code. For example, each of the following `for if switch while else || && != ==` if encountered in Java would increment that files complexity by one.

### Complexity Estimates

Lets take a minute to discuss the complexity estimate itself.

The complexity estimate is really just a number that is only comparable to files in the same language. It should not be used to compare languages directly without weighting them. The reason for this is that its calculated by looking for branch and loop statements in the code and incrementing a counter for that file.

Because some languages don't have loops and instead use recursion they can have a lower complexity count. Does this mean they are less complex? Probably not, but the tool cannot see this because it does not build an AST of the code as it only scans through it.

Generally though the complexity there is to help estimate between projects written in the same language, or for finding the most complex file in a project `scc --by-file -s complexity` which can be useful when you are estimating on how hard something is to maintain, or when looking for those files that should probably be refactored.

As for how it works.

It's my own definition, but tries to be an approximation of cyclomatic complexity https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity although done only on a file level. 

The reason it's an approximation is that it's calculated almost for free from a CPU point of view (since its a cheap lookup when counting), whereas a real cyclomatic complexity count would need to parse the code. It gives a reasonable guess in practice though even if it fails to identify recursive methods. The goal was never for it to be exact.

In short when scc is looking through what it has identified as code if it notices what are usually branch conditions it will increment a counter.

The conditions it looks for are compiled into the code and you can get an idea for them by looking at the JSON inside the repository. See https://github.com/boyter/scc/blob/master/languages.json#L3524 for an example of what it's looking at for a file that's Java.

The increment happens for each of the matching conditions and produces the number you see.

### COCOMO

The COCOMO statistics displayed at the bottom of any command line run can be configured as needed.

```
Estimated Cost to Develop (organic) $664,081
Estimated Schedule Effort (organic) 11.772217 months
Estimated People Required (organic) 5.011633
```

To change the COCOMO parameters, you can either use one of the default COCOMO models.

```
scc --cocomo-project-type organic
scc --cocomo-project-type semi-detached
scc --cocomo-project-type embedded
```

You can also supply your own parameters if you are familiar with COCOMO as follows,

```
scc --cocomo-project-type "custom,1,1,1,1"
```

See below for details about how the model choices, and the parameters they use.

Organic – A software project is said to be an organic type if the team size required is adequately small, the
problem is well understood and has been solved in the past and also the team members have a nominal experience
regarding the problem.

`scc --cocomo-project-type "organic,2.4,1.05,2.5,0.38"`

Semi-detached – A software project is said to be a Semi-detached type if the vital characteristics such as team-size,
experience, knowledge of the various programming environment lie in between that of organic and Embedded.
The projects classified as Semi-Detached are comparatively less familiar and difficult to develop compared to
the organic ones and require more experience and better guidance and creativity. Eg: Compilers or
different Embedded Systems can be considered of Semi-Detached type.

`scc --cocomo-project-type "semi-detached,3.0,1.12,2.5,0.35"`

Embedded – A software project with requiring the highest level of complexity, creativity, and experience
requirement fall under this category. Such software requires a larger team size than the other two models
and also the developers need to be sufficiently experienced and creative to develop such complex models.

`scc --cocomo-project-type "embedded,3.6,1.20,2.5,0.32"`

### Large File Detection

You can have `scc` exclude large files from the output. 

The option to do so is `--no-large` which by default will exclude files over 1,000,000 bytes or 40,000 lines.

You can control the size of either value using `--large-byte-count` or `--large-line-count`.

For example to exclude files over 1,000 lines and 50kb you could use the following,

`scc --no-large --large-byte-count 50000 --large-line-count 1000`

### Minified/Generated File Detection

You can have `scc` identify and optionally remove files identified as being minified or generated from the output.

You can do so by enabling the `-z` flag like so `scc -z` which will identify any file with an average line byte size >= 255 (by default) as being minified.

Minified files appear like so in the output.

```
$ scc --no-cocomo -z ./examples/minified/jquery-3.1.1.min.js
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Language                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
JavaScript (min)             1         4        0         1        3         17
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Total                        1         4        0         1        3         17
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Processed 86709 bytes, 0.087 megabytes (SI)
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

Minified files are indicated with the text `(min)` after the language name.

Generated files are indicated with the text `(gen)` after the language name.

You can control the average line byte size using `--min-gen-line-length` such as `scc -z --min-gen-line-length 1`. Please note you need `-z` as modifying this value does not imply minified detection.

You can exclude minified files from the count totally using the flag `--no-min-gen`. Files which match the minified check will be excluded from the output.

### Remapping

Some files may not have an extension. They will be checked to see if they are a #! file. If they are then the language will be remapped to the 
correct language. Otherwise, it will not process.

However, you may have the situation where you want to remap such files based on a string inside it. To do so you can use `--remap-unknown`

```
 scc --remap-unknown "-*- C++ -*-":"C Header"
```

The above will inspect any file with no extension looking for the string `-*- C++ -*-` and if found remap the file to be counted using the C Header rules. 
You can have multiple remap rules if required,

```
 scc --remap-unknown "-*- C++ -*-":"C Header","other":"Java"
```

There is also the `--remap-all` parameter which will remap all files.

Note that in all cases if the remap rule does not apply normal #! rules will apply.

### Output Formats

By default `scc` will output to the console. However you can produce output in other formats if you require.

The different options are `tabular, wide, json, csv, csv-stream, cloc-yaml, html, html-table, sql, sql-insert, openmetrics`. 

Note that you can write `scc` output to disk using the `-o, --output` option. This allows you to specify a file to
write your output to. For example `scc -f html -o output.html` will run `scc` against the current directory, and output
the results in html to the file `output.html`.

You can also write to multiple output files, or multiple types to stdout if you want using the `--format-multi` option. This is 
most useful when working in CI/CD systems where you want HTML reports as an artefact while also displaying the counts in stdout. 

```
scc --format-multi "tabular:stdout,html:output.html,csv:output.csv"
```

The above will run against the current directory, outputting to standard output the the default output, as well as writing
to output.html and output.csv with the appropriate formats.

#### Tabular 

This is the default output format when scc is run.

#### Wide 

Wide produces some additional information which is the complexity/lines metric. This can be useful when trying to
identify the most complex file inside a project based on the complexity estimate.

#### JSON

JSON produces JSON output. Mostly designed to allow `scc` to feed into other programs.

Note that this format will give you the byte size of every file `scc` reads allowing you to get a breakdown of the
number of bytes processed.

#### CSV

CSV as an option is good for importing into a spreadsheet for analysis. 

Note that this format will give you the byte size of every file `scc` reads allowing you to get a breakdown of the
number of bytes processed. Also note that CSV respects `--by-file` and as such will return a summary by default.

#### CSV-Stream

csv-stream is an option useful for processing very large repositories where you are likely to run into memory issues. It's output format is 100% the same as CSV. 

Note that you should not use this with the `format-multi` option as it will always print to standard output, and because of how it works will negate the memory saving it normally gains.
savings that this option provides. Note that there is no sort applied with this option. 

#### cloc-yaml 

Is a drop in replacement for cloc using its yaml output option. This is quite often used for passing into other 
build systems and can help with replacing cloc if required.

```
$ scc -f cloc-yml processor

#### HTML and HTML-TABLE

The HTML output options produce a minimal html report using a table that is either standalone `html` or as just a table `html-table`
which can be injected into your own HTML pages. The only difference between the two is that the `html` option includes 
html head and body tags with minimal styling.

The markup is designed to allow your own custom styles to be applied. An example report
[is here to view](SCC-OUTPUT-REPORT.html).

Note that the HTML options follow the command line options, so you can use `scc --by-file -f html` to produce a report with every
file and not just the summary.

Note that this format if it has the `--by-file` option will give you the byte size of every file `scc` reads allowing you to get a breakdown of the
number of bytes processed.

#### SQL and SQL-Insert

The SQL output format "mostly" compatible with cloc's SQL output format https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc#sql-

While all queries on the cloc documentation should work as expected, you will not be able to append output from `scc` and `cloc` into the same database. This is because the table format is slightly different
to account for scc including complexity counts and bytes.

The difference between `sql` and `sql-insert` is that `sql` will include table creation while the latter will only have the insert commands.

Usage is 100% the same as any other `scc` command but sql output will always contain per file details. You can compute totals yourself using SQL.

The below will run scc against the current directory, name the output as the project scc and then pipe the output to sqlite to put into the database code.db

```
scc --format sql --sql-project scc . | sqlite3 code.db
```

Assuming you then wanted to append another project

```
scc --format sql-insert --sql-project redis . | sqlite3 code.db
```

You could then run SQL against the database,

```
sqlite3 code.db 'select project,file,max(nCode) as nL from t
                         group by project order by nL desc;'
```

See the cloc documentation for more examples.


#### OpenMetrics

[OpenMetrics](https://openmetrics.io/) is a metric reporting format specification extending the Prometheus exposition text format.

The produced output is natively supported by [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [GitLab CI](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/metrics_reports.html)

Note that OpenMetrics respects `--by-file` and as such will return a summary by default.

The output includes a metadata header containing definitions of the returned metrics: 
```text
# TYPE scc_files count
# HELP scc_files Number of sourcecode files.
# TYPE scc_lines count
# UNIT scc_lines lines
# HELP scc_lines Number of lines.
# TYPE scc_code count
# HELP scc_code Number of lines of actual code.
# TYPE scc_comments count
# HELP scc_comments Number of comments.
# TYPE scc_blanks count
# HELP scc_blanks Number of blank lines.
# TYPE scc_complexity count
# HELP scc_complexity Code complexity.
# TYPE scc_bytes count
# UNIT scc_bytes bytes
# HELP scc_bytes Size in bytes.
```

The header is followed by the metric data in either language summary form:
```text
scc_files{language="Go"} 1
scc_lines{language="Go"} 1000
scc_code{language="Go"} 1000
scc_comments{language="Go"} 1000
scc_blanks{language="Go"} 1000
scc_complexity{language="Go"} 1000
scc_bytes{language="Go"} 1000
```

or, if `--by-file` is present, in per file form:
```text
scc_lines{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
scc_code{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
scc_comments{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
scc_blanks{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
scc_complexity{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
scc_bytes{language="Go",file="./bbbb.go"} 1000
```

### Performance

Generally `scc` will the fastest code counter compared to any I am aware of and have compared against. The below comparisons are taken from the fastest alternative counters. See `Other similar projects` above to see all of the other code counters compared against. It is designed to scale to as many CPU's cores as you can provide.

However if you want greater performance and you have RAM to spare you can disable the garbage collector like the following on linux `GOGC=-1 scc .` which should speed things up considerably. For some repositories turning off the code complexity calculation via `-c` can reduce runtime as well.

Benchmarks are run on fresh 32 Core CPU Optimised Digital Ocean Virtual Machine 2022/09/20 all done using [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) with 3 warm-up runs and 10 timed runs.

If you enable duplicate detection expect performance to fall by about 20% in `scc`.

Performance is tracked over each release and presented below. Currently, the most recent release 3.1.0 is the fastest version.

### CI/CD Support

Some CI/CD systems which will remain nameless do not work very well with the box-lines used by `scc`. To support those systems better there is an option `--ci` which will change the default output to ASCII only.

```
$ scc --ci main.go
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Language                 Files     Lines   Blanks  Comments     Code Complexity
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go                           1       272        7         6      259          4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Total                        1       272        7         6      259          4
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Estimated Cost to Develop $6,539

Estimated People Required 0.341437
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processed 5674 bytes, 0.006 megabytes (SI)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

The `--format-multi` option is especially useful in CI/CD where you want to get multiple output formats useful for storage or reporting.

### Development

If you want to hack away feel free! PR's are accepted. Some things to keep in mind. If you want to change a language definition you need to update `languages.json` and then run `go generate` which will convert it into the `processor/constants.go` file.

For all other changes ensure you run all tests before submitting. You can do so using `go test ./...`. However for maximum coverage please run `test-all.sh` which will run `gofmt`, unit tests, race detector and then all of the integration tests. All of those must pass to ensure a stable release.

### API Support

The core part of `scc` which is the counting engine is exposed publicly to be integrated into other Go applications. See https://github.com/pinpt/ripsrc for an example of how to do this. 

It also powers all of the code calculations displayed in https://searchcode.com/ such as https://searchcode.com/file/169350674/main.go/ making it one of the more used code counters in the world.

However as a quick start consider the following,

Note that you must pass in the number of bytes in the content in order to ensure it is counted!

```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io/ioutil"

	"github.com/boyter/scc/v3/processor"
)

type statsProcessor struct{}

func (p *statsProcessor) ProcessLine(job *processor.FileJob, currentLine int64, lineType processor.LineType) bool {
	switch lineType {
	case processor.LINE_BLANK:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "BLANK")
	case processor.LINE_CODE:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "CODE")
	case processor.LINE_COMMENT:
		fmt.Println(currentLine, "lineType", "COMMENT")
	}
	return true
}

func main() {
	bts, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("somefile.go")

	t := &statsProcessor{}
	filejob := &processor.FileJob{
		Filename: "test.go",
		Language: "Go",
		Content:  bts,
		Callback: t,
		Bytes:    int64(len(bts)),
	}

	processor.ProcessConstants() // Required to load the language information and need only be done once
	processor.CountStats(filejob)
}
```


### Adding/Modifying Languages

To add or modify a language you will need to edit the `languages.json` file in the root of the project, and then run `go generate` to build it into the application. You can then `go install` or `go build` as normal to produce the binary with your modifications.

### Issues

Its possible that you may see the counts vary between runs. This usually means one of two things. Either something is changing or locking the files under scc, or that you are hitting ulimit restrictions. To change the ulimit see the following links.

 - https://superuser.com/questions/261023/how-to-change-default-ulimit-values-in-mac-os-x-10-6#306555
 - https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/108174/how-to-persistently-control-maximum-system-resource-consumption-on-mac/221988#221988
 - https://access.redhat.com/solutions/61334
 - https://serverfault.com/questions/356962/where-are-the-default-ulimit-values-set-linux-centos
 - https://www.tecmint.com/increase-set-open-file-limits-in-linux/

To help identify this issue run scc like so `scc -v .` and look for the message `too many open files` in the output. If it is there you can rectify it by setting your ulimit to a higher value.

### Low Memory

If you are running `scc` in a low memory environment < 512 MB of RAM you may need to set `--file-gc-count` to a lower value such as `0` to force the garbage collector to be on at all times.

A sign that this is required will be `scc` crashing with panic errors.

### Tests

scc is pretty well tested with many unit, integration and benchmarks to ensure that it is fast and complete.

### Package

Packaging as of version v3.1.0 is done through https://goreleaser.com/ 

### Containers

Note if you plan to run `scc` in Alpine containers you will need to build with CGO_ENABLED=0.

See the below dockerfile as an example on how to achieve this based on this issue https://github.com/boyter/scc/issues/208

```
FROM golang as scc-get

ENV GOOS=linux \
GOARCH=amd64 \
CGO_ENABLED=0

ARG VERSION
RUN git clone --branch $VERSION --depth 1 https://github.com/boyter/scc
WORKDIR /go/scc
RUN go build -ldflags="-s -w"

FROM alpine
COPY --from=scc-get /go/scc/scc /bin/
ENTRYPOINT ["scc"]
```

### Badges (beta)

You can use `scc` to provide badges on your github/bitbucket/gitlab/sr.ht open repositories. For example, [![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
 The format to do so is,

https://sloc.xyz/PROVIDER/USER/REPO

An example of the badge for `scc` is included below, and is used on this page.

```
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
```

By default the badge will show the repo's lines count. You can also specify for it to show a different category, by using the `?category=` query string. 

Valid values include `code, blanks, lines, comments, cocomo` and examples of the appearance are included below.

[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=code)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=blanks)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=lines)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=comments)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)
[![Scc Count Badge](https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo)](https://github.com/boyter/scc/)


For `cocomo` you can also set the `avg-wage` value similar to `scc` itself. For example,

https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo&avg-wage=1
https://sloc.xyz/github/boyter/scc/?category=cocomo&avg-wage=100000 

Note that the avg-wage value must be a positive integer otherwise it will revert back to the default value of 56286.

*NB* it may not work for VERY large repositories (has been tested on Apache hadoop/spark without issue).

You can find the source code for badges in the repository at https://github.com/boyter/scc/blob/master/cmd/badges/main.go
